# shopping
A small browser based shopping application made with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.
It was designed to help us make shopping trips to markets. :)

The requirements of the application were:
- It should be responsive and work on desktops and phones
- When a user etc. adds or collects a product, all the other application users should know about it right a way.

Biggest issues right now:
- Event handling not done properly at the moment (just testing it). Bugs on server- and client-side (JS).
- Layout (menu & CSS)

Possible updates in the future:
- User control, possibility to add and manage users and manage better their shopping carts.
